1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

*HTTP1.1
It works on the textual format.
There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.
It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
It compresses data by itself.

*HTTP2
It works on the binary protocol.
It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages
It uses HPACK for data compression.


2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

*JAVA SCRIPT OBJECT
Objects are a fundamental aspect of JavaScript
JavaScript objects are containers for named values called properties
They can hold various data types, including strings, numbers, arrays, and even other objects
Object properties can be accessed and modified using dot notation or bracket notation
Objects are a fundamental aspect of JavaScript and are used extensively in web development.

*ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION
In JavaScript, every object has an internal representation that consists of:
[[Prototype]]: A reference to another object that the current object inherits properties from.
[[Class]]: A string that indicates the type of object, such as "Object", "Array", or "Function".
[[Extensible]]: A boolean value that indicates whether new properties can be added to the object.
[[Get]] and [[Set]]: Methods used to access and modify the object's properties, respectively.
